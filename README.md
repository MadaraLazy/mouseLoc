The project is a simple application designed to track the coordinates of the mouse on a computer screen. It is implemented using Java with a basic user interface displayed in a small window. The program continuously updates the mouse coordinates, displaying the current X and Y values in the window.

Additionally, the project includes the ability to copy the mouse coordinates to the clipboard when the 'x' key is pressed. It utilizes Java AWT and Swing techniques for creating the simple interface and handling keyboard events.

The application allows users to monitor mouse movement while providing an easy way to copy the current coordinates when needed.
